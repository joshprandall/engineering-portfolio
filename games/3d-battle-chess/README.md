# Crown & Ash

A standalone, browser-based, 3D chess combat game created and directed by Joshua Randall.

## Play and features

The game supports local two-player chess and a computer opponent (Black), five selectable procedural sets (Classic, Arcane, Monsters, Brick Battle and Cosmic War), theme-specific animated captures, a 3D orbit/zoom camera, board flipping, synthesized sound, responsive touch input, an accessible coordinate-move field, move history, and undo.

Chess rules are implemented in `engine.js`: legal moves, king safety, check, checkmate, stalemate, castling, en passant, four promotion choices, threefold repetition, fifty-move draws and supported insufficient-material draws. The computer opponent uses a compact local search and is not a professional-strength engine.

## Run locally

Serve this folder from a static HTTP server, then open its `index.html` (ES modules generally do not run reliably from `file://`). For example, with Python installed:

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Open `http://localhost:8000/` in a modern WebGL-capable browser with internet access. No build step or npm installation is needed to play. The web page loads three.js and OrbitControls through the pinned jsDelivr URLs in its import map; it therefore requires a network connection to load those modules.

## Tests

With Node.js 22 or later, run `npm test`. The automated tests exercise the chess rules and computer move legality. The tests do not replace browser/device verification.

## Safe website deployment

Upload the files together into a dedicated directory such as `public_html/games/3d-battle-chess/`. Keep `index.html`, `styles.css`, `battle.js` and `engine.js` in that directory. Link to `/~randjosh/games/3d-battle-chess/` from your existing portfolio. Do not overwrite the portfolio root `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, or any existing game or Qubit folders.
